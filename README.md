# SURE-2024
Hello! My name is Patrick Weiss, I am an undergraduate researcher working in the WVU Interactive Robotics Laboratory (IRL). This is a repository for the work I completed during the WVU Summer Undergraduate Research Experience during the summer of 2024. I completed this research under the guidance of Dr. Yu Gu and PhD student Trevor Smith. My research focused on the implementation and demonstration of reflex-based control in multistaged tendon-driven continuum robots.

# Abstract: Reflex-Based Control of Multi-Staged Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots
Conventional rigid link robotic structures are often limited in their ability to navigate complex geometries and cramped environments. In contrast, continuum robots, with their inherent compliance and flexibility, can bend around obstacles, making them highly advantageous for such tasks. This study explores the use of a continuously deformable compression spring backbone in a tendon-driven continuum robot to enable elastic compliance and flexible actuation. The primary aim is to demonstrate how reflexes, defined as involuntary and rapid responses to external stimuli, can be integrated into continuum robotics to achieve more "organic-like" control. We hypothesize that implementing reflex control can result in more robust control systems and faster response times. Our approach involves developing a tendon-driven actuation mechanism where forces applied to the tendons create bending motions, simulating reflexive responses. We predict that the decentralized nature of the reflex control structure will enhance the robot's ability to quickly adapt to its environment, offering potential advantages over traditional centralized control systems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to develop an unconventional robotics control architecture, making robots more adaptable and resilient in dynamic and complex environments. This advancement could have broad implications for various fields, including medical robotics, remote maintenance, and industrial automation, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient and capable robotic systems.
